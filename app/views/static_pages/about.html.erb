<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
  The <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>
  is a project to make a book and screencasts to teach web development
  with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. It's pretty 
  good and I'm learning a lot about web development, so hopefully I'll
  make something cool here (eventually).
